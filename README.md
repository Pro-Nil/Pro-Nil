### 🌱A little bit about me.

Hello, I'm Pro_Nil and I am a Programmer. I mostly code in Java and run several projects coded with it. My biggest project including Java at the moment probably is StudioBeam Development , a Minecraft Plugin Development team making everything affordable.

I started coding at the start of the pandemic, 1 week later all of us were in lockdown. Now I had time. Much time. So I started learning Java and did this all day. And I don't regret it.

Volunteered for 15+ Minecraft Servers .
Positive review from over 20+ clients !

On my way I found many friendly people, some of which I'm still friended with to this date, some might left me or I left them, both ways possible. I'm normally quite busy with school and coding, but that's life.

I currently am mostly active in the following Projects: StudioBeam Development and ...... . They are fun and I learnt a lot while working on them. Both include the game Minecraft.
