### üå±A little bit about me.

Hello, I'm Pranil (you might also know me as Pro_Nil). I'm a self-taught engineer and creator with a deep passion for building things‚Äîfrom complex software and custom hardware to compelling visual stories.

My journey into the tech world began during the pandemic, and what started as a curiosity for Java quickly grew into a full-time passion for solving real-world problems. This path led me to found StudioBeam Development, where I've had the privilege of architecting and shipping commercial software to over 150 paying customers and supporting a community of thousands with my open-source tools.

While my core expertise is in backend engineering and cybersecurity, my curiosity doesn't stop at code. I've designed and created custom PCBs for hardware projects like a force-feedback steering wheel, produced detailed film treatments for my photography passion , and honed skills in graphic design.

Recently, this drive to understand how systems work led me to discover and responsibly disclose a security vulnerability in a national government website, which was officially acknowledged by the Indian Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT-In).

I'm always building and learning.
